# ARPG-Enemy-System
A robust AI system, developed in a short time frame, focused on emulating the behavior of the enemies in Diablo 3. The goal was to recreate the concept that enemies adapt to the flow of battle to aid each other and fight together to try to defeat the player, rather than acting as isolated entities.
